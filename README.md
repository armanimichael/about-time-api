# About Time API

An API for the Application I'm developing for Human-Computer Class at University.<br/>
I'll eventually create a front-end, either as a Mobile App or Web App.

The API uses ExpressJS and MongoDB, everything is written in TypeScript.

## Environmental Variables

- `DB_HOST`: MongoDB Host
- `PORT`: Server Port

## Setup

Build Application (compile in JavaScript inside `build`)

```
yarn build
```

Run API

```
yarn start
```

Real Time Development

```
yarn dev
```

## This is not production ready

This repository is not production ready. The entire project has testing purposes, for now.
